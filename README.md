### Compute Unit Consumption

The actor is optimized to run in a very fast manner and scrape the flights in the most performant way. Therefore, it forefronts all flight result requests. If the actor doesn't block very often it'll scrape 100 flights in 30 seconds with ~0.01-0.05 compute units.

### Google Flights Scraper Input example

```json
{
    "startUrls": [
        "https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhoeEgoyMDI0LTA3LTAyagcIARIDQU1TcgcIARIDQkVSGh4SCjIwMjQtMDctMzFqBwgBEgNCRVJyBwgBEgNBTVNAAUgBcAGCAQsI____________AZgBAQ"
    ],
    "mode": "oneWay",
    "departure": "LHR",
    "arrival": "MAD",
    "departureDate": "2024-07-01",
    "returnDate": "2024-08-01",
    "adults":1,
    "proxy":{
        "useApifyProxy": true
    }
}
```

## During the Run

During the run, the actor will output messages letting you know what is going on.
When items are loaded from the page, you should see a message about this event with a loaded item count.

If you provide incorrect input to the actor, it will immediately stop with a failure state and output an explanation of what is wrong.

## Google Flights Export

During the run, the actor stores results into a dataset. Each item is a separate item in the dataset.

You can manage the results in any language (Python, PHP, Node JS/NPM). See the FAQ or <a href="https://www.apify.com/docs/api" target="blank">our API reference</a> to learn more about getting results from this Google Flights actor.
